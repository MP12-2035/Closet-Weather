# SmartWardrobe üß•üëó

A personal wardrobe assistant that helps you manage your clothes, plan outfits, and get AI-powered style recommendations based on weather and occasion.

---

## **Project Overview**

SmartWardrobe is designed in stages to progressively turn your closet into a **smart, AI-powered assistant**:

### **Stage 1 ‚Äì Basic Weather-Responsive Outfit Planner**

* Log your clothes manually (type, color, style).
* Get outfit suggestions based on the current weather.
* Example: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raining, wear your waterproof jacket with boots.‚Äù

### **Stage 2 ‚Äì Automatic Closet Scanning**

* Take photos of your clothes ‚Üí the app automatically detects and catalogs them.
* Assign attributes like type, color, and pattern.
* Optional: basic visual modeling to preview items in the app (e.g., drawing a rough representation of a blue top).

### **Stage 3 ‚Äì AI Outfit Recommendations**

* Smart recommendations for your wardrobe gaps (e.g., ‚ÄúYou have many pastel shirts but few bottoms that match‚Äù).
* Ask natural language questions:

  * ‚ÄúGoing to a party tonight‚Äîwhat should I wear?‚Äù
  * Suggestions consider **weather, occasion, and your existing wardrobe**.
* Integration with computer vision and NLP to create a personalized style assistant.
